# Course Assignment

## Goal

To put into practice the technologies you’ve learned in Web and Communications Technology.

## Brief

In this assignment you have been tasked with organizing your files and folders in order to start developing the website on which you chose to work in Design 1.

You need to create a repository for your code, as well as upload the folder structure to your web host.

## Level 1 Process

1. Create a repository on GitHub for your project and choose an appropriate name for your project.
1. Clone the repository to your computer and open in VS Code.
1. Add the index.html file provided under resources to the root folder for your project. It’s important that it’s called index.html because the server will look for this filename to show as the home page.
1. Create folders called: ‘styles’, ‘js’, and ‘images’. They can be empty folders for now. We’ll add to them as we progress in the programme.
1. Commit and push changes to your repository.
1. Deploy the site using Netlify.
